# Palette
## A Multi-Purpose WebApp Built Around Drawing
**Palette** is a small yet powerful WebApp built primariy in Golang. It is designed to create a web server in which people can easily join and create lobbies to draw. Currently, the system features a streamable whiteboard where the host of a lobby can free draw for everyone in the lobby and a customizable pictionary mode. The customizable whiteboard makes use of many features within JavaScript in order to allow the artist to truly lay their mind on the page.

After learning about the HTML canvas and the capabilities that it held paired with JavaScript, I initially intended on making a [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/ "Skribbl.io by @ticedev on Twitter") clone. After spending countless hours for one week straight, coding and learning about JavaScript/Golang, I decided to make this WebApp much more. As of 3/1/21, this is my most advanced project.
