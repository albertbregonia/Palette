# Palette
## A Multi-Purpose WebApp Built Around Drawing
**Palette** is a small yet powerful WebApp built primariy in Golang. It is designed to create a web server in which people can join and create lobbies and draw. Currently, the system features a streamable whiteboard where the host of a lobby can free draw for everyone in the lobby and a customizable pictionary mode.

After learning about the HTML canvas and the capabilities that it held paired with JavaScript, I initially intended on making a [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/ "Skribbl.io by @ticedev on Twitter") clone. After spending countless hours for one week straight, coding and learning about JavaScript/Golang, I decided to make this WebApp much more. As of 3/1/21, this is my most advanced project.
